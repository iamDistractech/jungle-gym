### Tech stack

## :gear: Installation

### Developing

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte);

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Building

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.

### Environment Variables

Copy the `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`.

### Husky

[Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) is used to format your code (automatically) on commit.

In order to use Husky you have to install it with `npm run prepare`. This will install Husky for your project.

The next time you commit, Husky will automatically format it for you.
